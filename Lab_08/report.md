## Objectives
Program your microontroller to transmit:<br>
"F0" if SW1 is pressed<br>
"AA" if SW2 is pressed <br>
Over UART with baud rate 9600 and odd parity. <br>
Your program should also listen for incoming data on the UART with the same baud and parity config; if "AA" is received LED should be GREEN; if "F0" is recieved, the LED should be BLUE and if any error is detected LED should be RED. Test this by communicating with your neighboring group.<br>
